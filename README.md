Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is the study of making machines more human
like in their behaviour and decisions by giving them the ability to learn and develop their own programs. This is done
with minimum human intervention i.e. no explicit programming. The learning process is automated and improved based on 
the experiences of the machines throughout the process. Good quality data is fed to the machines, and different 
algorithms are used to build ML models to train the machines on this data. The choice of algorithm depends on the 
type of data at hand, and the type of activity that needs to be automated. 
Types of machine learning are
1. Supervises Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement
If we have to build a software for student attendance system by facial recognition is a good example for machine
learning.
